## Features

#### Refined Checkout

Building upon the streamlined checkout built into Elements, Shadows offers 
a more styled approach to the checkout process..

#### Customer Dashboard

The account landing page has been rethought and restyled to give returning 
customers more, 'at-a-glance', information. Customers will be able to see

a little less cramped on smaller screens.
